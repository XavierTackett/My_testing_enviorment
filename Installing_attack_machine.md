Now that we have the hypervisor install we can get to installing our choice of attacking machines, 
but for the time being I'm going to use because it has all the tools needed and is one of the most used Linux distro for attacking

1. Choose which linux distro you want to use as your attack machine.

2. Next click download and choose which version you would like to use ***(Make sure its a ISO file)***

3. It should take a while because you are installing a whole other machine on your system, depending on the version you chose.
Now that we have our hypervisor and attacking machine its time to move to the target machine then I'll show how to install both attacking and target VM's

4. Now open Virtual Box (you might have to search for it the first time), after its open click the "machine" button on the upper left hand corner and select "New"

5. You know your in the right spot when you reach this point, from here you want to choose the ISO file that you installed and select a folder where you want the infomation from that machine to be stored, I suggest creating seperate folder to store the things in

6. Next choose how much resources you would like the machine to use (remember these are resources your going to share with you main computer), I chose this amount becuause it runs smooth but you could do more

7. Next create a virtual hard disk (this is going to create a partion of you storage just for this machine) I suggest to at least do 15GB to 20GB and up.

8. then that should be it now you can continue and click finish

9. Now do the same for the target machine and you should be ready to go
