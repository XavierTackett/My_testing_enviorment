Now that we have the hypervisor install we can get to installing our choice of attacking machines, 
but for the time being I'm going to use because it has all the tools needed and is one of the most used Linux distro for attacking

1. Choose which linux distro you want to use as your attack machine.

Now that we have our hypervisor and attacking machine its time to move to the target machine then I'll show how to install both attacking and target VM's
